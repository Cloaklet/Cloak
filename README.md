# Cloak

A simple GUI app wrapping around gocryptfs using web tech stack. Currently a work in progress.

I wrote a similar GUI using QML + Golang called [Cloaklet](https://github.com/Cloaklet/Cloaklet). However I don't enjoy developing QML at all, and it had some issues that I was unable to resolve. This is my latest effort to do the same thing, but the UI now lives in the browser.

UI / interaction mimicked from Cryptomator.
